In theory, you can also use [Jekyll hooks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/hooks/) to do it, but I haven't figured out a way that looks nice yet.


## Search The Data & Methods

Below is where we can put some links to both the data and the analysis code as buttons:

```
<div class="left">
{% include elements/button.html link="https://github.com/vega/vega/blob/main/docs/data/cars.json" text="The Data" %}
</div>

<div class="right">
{% include elements/button.html link="https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2021/05/03/Interactive-Visualizations.html" text="The Analysis" %}
</div>
```

<!-- these are written in a combo of html and liquid --> 

<div class="left">
{% include elements/button.html link="https://github.com/vega/vega/blob/main/docs/data/cars.json" text="The Data" %}
</div>

<div class="right">
{% include elements/button.html link="https://github.com/jnaiman/online_cv_public/blob/main/python_notebooks/test_generate_plots.ipynb" text="The Analysis" %}
</div>
